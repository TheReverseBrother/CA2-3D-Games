## Description:
Students  must  produce  a  simple  3D  platform  or  puzzle  game  (e.g.  Pac  Man, Fotonica, Bloxorz,  EdgeEX, CubeRacer, Hexagon, Crossy Road, BattleZone) to demonstrate the following functionality:


* Textured  3D  primitives -Your  game  must  demonstrate  the  use  of  Vertex  and  Index  Buffers when applied to texture mapped 3D primitives. You are notallowed to use any models created in  a  3D  modelling  package.  Your  game  must  include  a  minimum  of threedifferent  primitive forms, of which at least one primitive must use both vertexand index buffers.(10marks)
* Game  Camera -Camera  may  be  from  aFixed, Isometric,  First-person  or  Third-person perspective.(5marks)
* Intro Camera -At the start of your game your camera will move along a 3D curve to provide an overview  of  the  game  space.  This  curve  must  contain twobends.  See  TrackCameraControllerclasses. (5marks)
* Sound -Your  game  must  include  the  use  of  a  minimum  of threediegetic  sound  sources  and onenon-diegetic sound source. Sounds may be in “2D”or 3D.(10marks)

* Collision Detection & Collision Response -Collision detection should prevent player character, non-player  characters,  and  game  objects  from  clipping  each  other  within the  game  world.  The collision response that  you apply should be appropriate for the mechanics of  your game. Your CD/CR code mayonlyuse the BoundingBox, BoundingFrustum, or BoundingSphere classes. (10marks)

* Frustum  culling -Game  objects  should  only  be  drawn  if  the  camera  frustum  intersects  (or contains) the objects in the object manager.(10marks)

* Game Levels -Your game must include twodistinct game levels differentiated by the difficultyof each level. Difficulty may be increased by varying the number of onscreen enemies, threats or obstacles; the speed at which action takes place; or the damage inflicted by threats, enemies or  obstacles.  Your  game mustinclude  either3+obstacles, 3+collectables,  or 2+enemy characters. (20marks)

* Creativity/Playability -Your  game  will  be  graded  based  on  the originalityof  your  game concept, the complexityof thegameplay mechanics, and the playabilityof your game. (3x 10marks)
